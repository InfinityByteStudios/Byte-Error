- **Hit Sparks**: Particle effects for bullet hits, enemy destruction, and special events
- **Screen Shake**: Dynamic screen shake for impacts, explosions, and special abilities
- **Damage Numbers**: Floating damage indicators for visual feedback
- **Particle System**: Comprehensive particle management with lifetime, physics, and rendering

#### 2. Enemy Visual Effects
- **Enemy Hit Effects**: `visualEffects.onEnemyHit(x, y, damage)` - Hit sparks and screen shake
- **Enemy Destruction**: `visualEffects.onEnemyDestroyed(x, y, enemyType)` - Explosion effects with type-specific colors
- **Enemy Spawn Effects**: `visualEffects.onEnemySpawn(x, y, enemyType)` - Spawn particles with enemy-specific colors

#### 3. Player Visual Effects
- **Player Damage**: `visualEffects.onPlayerHit(x, y, damage)` - Red hit sparks and damage numbers
- **Dash Activation**: `visualEffects.onDashUsed(x, y)` - Cyan sparks and screen shake when dashing
- **Overclock Activation**: `visualEffects.onOverclockActivated(x, y)` - Magenta explosion effect and strong screen shake

#### 4. Wave Management Effects
- **Wave Start**: `visualEffects.onWaveStart(waveNumber)` - Visual feedback for new waves
- **Wave Complete**: `visualEffects.onWaveComplete(waveNumber)` - Completion celebration effects

#### 5. Game Integration
- **Enemy Manager**: Integrated with collision system to trigger hit/destruction effects
- **Player Actions**: Dash and overclock activation now trigger visual effects automatically

### ðŸŽ® HOW TO TEST:
1. **Enemy Combat**: Shoot enemies to see hit sparks and destruction effects
2. **Player Dash**: Press `SPACE` to dash and see cyan visual effects
3. **Overclock**: Build charge by killing enemies, then press `Q` to activate overclock (magenta effects)
4. **Screen Shake**: All major actions now include appropriate screen shake feedback
5. **Damage Numbers**: Watch for floating damage numbers during combat

### ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

#### Player Class Changes:
- Modified `activateOverclock()` to return activation status
- Modified `startDash()` to return activation status  
- Updated `update()` method to track and return action events
- Added action event object with `dashActivated` and `overclockActivated` flags

#### Game Class Integration:
- Capture player action events from `player.update()`
- Automatically trigger visual effects for dash and overclock
- Maintains existing collision-based visual effects

#### Visual Effects System:
- Complete preset methods for all game events
- Screen shake system with configurable intensity and duration
- Particle system with physics, colors, and lifecycle management
- Integration with enemy manager for spawn/hit/destruction effects
